## Requirements

- MongoDB
> Note: May not be password protected. If you still need it, do your own customization directly on the code.

## Usage

`node with-graceful-shutdown/app.js`

## Important

In this example we are implementing the concept of _graceful shutdown_. So it takes about **0-10 seconds** to turn off the server that is running.
